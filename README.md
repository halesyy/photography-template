# Photohtaphy Portfolio Template

When not working for clients, I enjoy working on templates that I can use for new clients or to hone in on my skills.

This template is for someone who has a love for photography, and wants to represent themselves in a portfolio.

## Basic Documentation

To develop using this theme, the basic structure is **/dev** to **/assets**, and that's how all the scripts work.

It is recommended to install http://sass-lang.com/ and use the compiler when working with the SCSS files.

Simply run the Shell or Batch scripts `/dev/watch.sh` or `/dev/watch.bat`. You can do that by `cd`ing into the directory and running the `sh` command on them (for windows, just double click the file).
